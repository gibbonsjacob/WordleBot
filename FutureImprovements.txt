These changes are also noted in WordleBotMain.py


 Future improvements possible:
 Store past guesses and their sequence in a csv or JSON file so that it can be read in (this way you don't have to pass it as an arg)

 better way to score letters/words
         - Maybe also a longer list of test words
         - This could just be used to more accurately score letters/words, including words longer than 5 letters

 A way to decide when to introduce words with "letter multiples" (words with the same letter more than once)
         - Currently I don't introduce letter multiples until at least the third guess, but it's possible before that, in which case the bot returns null


 Improve how we consider past "Green" or "Yellow" letters! Currently the only consideration is if the letter is IN the word, not what it's location in the word is

 Also need a way to account for NO correct letters (it may be better to use IncorrectLetters as a required argument and CorrectLetters as optional
